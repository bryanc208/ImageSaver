#ImageSaver

ImageSaver is a webapp that loads popular images from various sources throughout the web and lets the user favorite them using a Facebook account to save their selections. It utilizes Facebook APIs and Parse to handle API calls. 

```
APIs used: 
  -Facebook Login
  -Imgur
  -Reddit
  -Giphy
```  
The APIs were called using AJAX and therefore when loading images from a specific subreddit, the page does not need to reload.
